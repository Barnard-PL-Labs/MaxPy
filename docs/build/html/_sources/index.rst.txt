MaxPy
=====

MaxPy is a package for generating MaxMSP patches with Python. It offers all the functionality of the Max environment, as well as the benefits of
text-based programming: mass-placement/connection of objects, random patch generation, procedural patch generation, and more. MaxPy can also import
existing patch files created in the Max environment, providing flexibility to move back and forth between visual and text-based programming.
