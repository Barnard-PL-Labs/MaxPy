# MaxPy
MaxPy is a Python package for metaprogramming of MaxMSP that uses Python to generate and edit Max patches. MaxPy allows users to move freely between text-based Python programming and visual programming in Max, making it much easier to implement dynamic patches, random patches, mass-placement and mass-connection of objects, and other easily text-programmed techniques.

[![Variable-Oscillator Synth Explanation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nxusu32kkxs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxusu32kkxs)      
Ranger explains a MaxPy script that dynamically generates an additive synth with a variable number of oscillators. The code for this synth is under [examples/variable-osc-synth](examples/variable-osc-synth).

## Formal Grammar of MaxMSP
To aid the development of MaxPy, we attempted to define a formal grammar of MaxMSP as a programming language. However, we discovered three major issues: 1) typing problems, 2) irregular objects, and 3) mismatches between saved program files and in-environment program behavior. See [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRzq-NvMRNXPquCyuzakgQNgc4mcXVVbJRlGcm-cyRzpWVJse_u1Dq0XG2G9H3So0_MNozzjAzeiH1_/pub) (in progress) for a writeup of these issues.
