# MaxPy
MaxPy is a Python package for generating and editing Max patches through text-based programming. MaxPy allows users to move freely between text-based Python programming and visual programming in Max, making it much easier to implement dynamic patches, random patches, mass-placement and mass-connection of objects, and other processes that are easily text-implemented.
